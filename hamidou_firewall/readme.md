Hamidou Firewall
Overview
The Hamidou Firewall is a simple, stateful inspection firewall with threat intelligence integration. It inspects incoming TCP packets, tracks connection states, and checks IP reputations against external services like VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB.

Features
Stateful Inspection: Tracks the state of TCP connections (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, FIN) and blocks non-established connections.
Threat Intelligence Integration: Uses VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB to verify IP reputations.
Logging: Logs all packet states and IP reputation checks into a file (firewall_log.txt).
Optional Web Dashboard: You can extend the project with a Flask-based web interface to visualize traffic and logs in real time.
Installation

Usage
Run the firewall:

python Hamidoufirewall.py
The firewall will listen for incoming TCP packets, log connection states, and check IP reputations. Logs will be stored in firewall_log.txt.
Optional Web Interface
To add a real-time dashboard using Flask:

Install Flask:

pip install Flask
Start the Flask server, which will serve the logs on a web interface.
