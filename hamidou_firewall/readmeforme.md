# Hamidou Firewall

## Overview

The **Hamidou Firewall** is an advanced firewall with stateful inspection, threat intelligence integration (VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB), and logging mechanisms. The firewall inspects packets, tracks the state of TCP connections, checks the reputation of IP addresses, and logs all actions in a file.

### Features:
- **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks the state of TCP connections (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, FIN).
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Uses VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB to check the reputation of IP addresses.
- **Logging**: Logs all connection states and IP reputation checks into a file (`firewall_log.txt`).
- **Web Interface (optional)**: You can add a web-based GUI using Flask to monitor traffic and logs in real-time.

## Requirements

### Libraries:
You need to install the following Python libraries before running the firewall:
- `socket`
- `requests`
- `struct`
- `threading`
- `Flask` (if you're adding the optional web interface)

You can install Flask using:
```bash
pip install Flask
API Keys:
Make sure you have valid API keys for:

VirusTotal: Add your VirusTotal API key in the script.
AbuseIPDB: Add your AbuseIPDB API key in the script.
How to Run
Open a terminal in your project directory.
Start the firewall:
bash
Copier le code
python Hamidoufirewall.py
The firewall will start listening to network traffic, logging connection states, and checking IP reputations.

Logs will be saved in firewall_log.txt.

Stateful Inspection
The firewall tracks the state of TCP connections. It recognizes:

SYN_SENT: A SYN packet has been sent but no response received yet.
SYN_RECEIVED: A SYN-ACK response has been received.
ESTABLISHED: The TCP handshake is complete and the connection is established.
FIN: The connection is being closed.
Packets are only allowed if they are part of an established connection. Any packet not part of a valid connection will be blocked and logged.

Threat Intelligence
The firewall integrates with two reputation-checking services:

VirusTotal: IP addresses are checked for any malicious reports.
AbuseIPDB: IP addresses are checked for abuse reports.
If an IP is flagged by either service, it will be logged as a warning. This helps in detecting malicious traffic in real time.

Web Dashboard (Optional)
You can add a simple Flask-based web dashboard to monitor the logs in real time. Install Flask and follow the steps to create a basic web interface. This allows you to visualize logs and traffic dynamically.

Stopping the Firewall
To stop the firewall, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the firewall is running.

Future Enhancements
Add GUI: A web-based GUI using Flask to display traffic and logs.
Enhanced Threat Intelligence: Integrate more external sources for IP/domain reputation checks.
